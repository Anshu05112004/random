    <p>Parampara is a Sanskrit word that refers to the succession of knowledge from one guru to the next.
       Directly translated to English, parampara means something like “uninterrupted series,” "continuation," 
      or "succession." An alternative name for this is guru-shishya, which translates to something along the lines of
       "succession from guru to disciple."<hr>
      This is a term that is often used in Hinduism as well as in other Indian religions.
      In the context of yoga,
      it usually refers to the means by which ancient yogic knowledge is passed.
